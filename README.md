# RyansWebScrapes

To use the Microsoft job alert web scraper, you will need:

1. A Discord channel with a [webhook](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) created
2. The link for a Microsoft Job Alert

Edit the params file [here](https://github.com/Kcam9908/RyansWebScrapes/blob/master/MicrosoftJobAlertScraper/params_file.py) and run the python program normally.
